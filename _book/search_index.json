This analysis can provide insights into the direct and indirect influences within our system. By estimating path coefficients and measuring the strength and direction of relationships, PLS-SEM models help infer the structural connections among ‘latent variables’, guiding our understanding of complex causal mechanisms within the system. While PLS-SEM doesn’t prove causation, it suggests plausible paths of influence within the system. PLS-SEM connects observed variables to their underlying concepts (latent variables). It combines factor analysis (which reduces reducing a large number of variables into a smaller set of factors, like PCA) with regression. However, unlike traditional regression, which focuses on directly observed variables, PLS-SEM aims to maximize the explained variance in the dependent variables and handles complex, indirect relationships and interactions in the system by evaluating two models at once. The measurement model evaluates relationships between our observed variables and underlying concepts (latent variables). For example, in our dataset, we might consider different measures of a latent variable ‘topography’ as watershed aspect, slope, elevation and indices derived from those measurements like the ‘total wetness index’ (indicators). We can simultaneously determine the relationships among our ‘indicators’ and between indicators and our latent variables while also evaluating the structural model, which looks for relationships between the latent variables. It is robust with non-normal data and ‘small’ samples. It can be used for both exploratory and confirmatory analysis.

For the time being, this generates a .csv that is imported to chapter 4. Inputs used in this script are inputsim_dh1_year and fool_input_year csvs that are generated from snowmelt models. Scripts are found in models_analysis/WECOH_deadhorse/1_precip/scripts/5_SNOTEL.SWE.Model.Deadhorse.LK.Rmd and a similar path for the Fool Creek WECOH workflow. Runoff and snowmelt are modeled for both, one model for each side of the East S. Louis catchament. Therefore Deadhorse estimations are also applied to Lexen in the PLS analysis. This is a summary of the precip data added to the PLS test iteration workflow. Blue represents the snowpack, orange is input. Each point represents the 3 day rolling average of each sample at the time it was collected. "],["correlations-plots.html", "3 Correlations plots:", " 3 Correlations plots: This script is an exploratory data visualization and testing multivariate procedures using the results of the 3-component PARAFAC model as response variables. PARAFAC methods: The corrected Excitation-emission matrix (EEM) were merged into a three-dimensional matrix and analyzed via the multivariate data analysis technique parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) (Murphy et al. 2013). PARAFAC is a statistical tool used to decompose trilinear data arrays to identify and quantify independent underlying signals or ’components’ (Bro, 1997). DOM components were resolved using PARAFAC analysis and the package staRdom (Pucher et al. 2019) in statistical software R (version). The three-component model was validated through split-half analysis, which generates independent models from subsamples of the dataset (Murphy et al. 2014). The similarity between these models was assessed using Tucker’s congruence coefficient, with all values exceeding 0.98. This fit required removing 8 outliers, the 8 points with the greatest and inordinate leverage. Following validation, the 3 component PARAFAC model (table) was uploaded to the OpenFluor spectral database (Murphy et al, 2014) to identify spectrally similar components across other studies. Records in the database matching our components with a Tucker congruence exceeding (check 0.98) were reviewed to improve interpretation component sources and functions. The model is then exported to a dataframe containing the sum of loadings (intensities) for each sample, and the total and relative loadings for each component is merged with a summary dataframe that contains DOC concentration, as well as landcover, discharge and topographical data for each sample. # Generate a discharge column that is normalized by the area of the respective watershed. merged_df&lt;- merged_df%&gt;% mutate(Qm3_s = replace_na(Qm3_s, 0.005)) merged_df$discharge_m2 &lt;- merged_df$Qm3_s/merged_df$area_m merged_df$Input.mm_m2 &lt;- merged_df$Input.mm/merged_df$area_m merged_df$snowpack_m2 &lt;- merged_df$snowpack_3day_avg/merged_df$area_m # Transform aspect from degrees to radians merged_df$aspect_mean_rad &lt;- merged_df$aspect_mean*pi/180 "],["parafac-results-summary-figures.html", "3.1 PARAFAC results summary figures:", " 3.1 PARAFAC results summary figures: Emission-Excitation matrices for the 3 components identified by the 3 component PARAFAC model.

"],["structure.html", "3.2 Structure:", " 3.2 Structure: There are a few ways we can group and explore this data. We can observe the PARAFAC components as fractions of the total fluorescence, i.e., the DOC ‘community’ structure. We can also review the DOC normalized fluorescence intensity of each component. This could help us better examine lability of DOC and how much fluorescence signal is produced per unit of carbon and differences in overall DOM reactivity (i.e., does a larger proportion of DOM fluoresce in some samples relative to others). This section will look first at distributions, correlations and PCA with relative loadings as the response variable, then follow a similar workflow with normalized DOC as the response. "],["relative-loadings.html", "3.3 1. Relative loadings", " 3.3 1. Relative loadings Relative loadings for each sample (i.e., loading for each component/total loading for the sample in the 3 component model). This tells us how much of each component contributes to the total fluorescence of that particular sample. 3.3.1 Box plots - Relative loadings Boxplots are visualizing relative loadings (component loading/total loading for the sample). These are not normalized by DOC concentration. This allows for comparisons between sites with varying DOC concentrations while avoiding the confounding effects of variations in DOC concentration.

Color indicates direction and correlation value (Pearson’s). Asterisks indicate level of significance. This figure indicates that: - The humic fraction of the fluorescing DOM decreases with high percentages of tundra, and short canopy. - The humic fraction increases with increasing watershed coverage with forest canopy between 6 and 10m, and increasing landcover classified as cut or regenerating. - There are low but significant correlations between humic fractions and % catchment coverage by beetle-kill, meadows and old forest. Humic fractions increase slightly with % Beetle Kill and decrease with increased with increased meadow or old forest coverage. - Protein-like fractions of the fluorescing DOM decrease with high percentages of cut or regenerating forest, and canopy between 6 and 10m, - but increase with increased coverage by short canopy (&lt;5m) and Tundra. - Significant but weaker correlations indicate that protein-like fractions increase with increasing meadow and old forest coverage. 3.3.3.1.2 Topo and moisture - all EEMS Figure 3.9: Figure. Combined plot showing the relationships between relative loadings of 3 PARAFAC components and topographic or moisture characteristics for all samples with EEMs data (July 2021- Oct 1, 2022). Color indicates direction and correlation value (Pearson’s). Asterisks indicate level of significance. This figure indicates that: - humic fraction of the fluorescing DOM increase with increasing discharge, watershed area, the distance that allochthonous water travels before reaching the stream channel (dist to streams mean), and increased watershed moisture (as indicated by NDMI and TWI). - Humic fractions decrease with increasing watershed slope. - Protein-like fractions of the fluorescing DOM increase with increasing slope - and decrease with increasing Q, watershed area, increasing moisture indices, and increased mean distance to the stream channel. 3.3.3.1.3 Ions - all EEMS Figure 3.10: Figure. Combined plot showing the relationships between relative loadings of 3 PARAFAC components and DOC (mg/L), and ions (mg/L) for all samples with EEMs data (July 2021- Oct 1, 2022). Color indicates direction and correlation value (Pearson’s). Asterisks indicate level of significance. This figure indicates that: - humic fraction of the fluorescing DOM increase with increasing DOM, sodium, potassium (K) and fluoride (F) concentration). - Humic fractions decrease with increasing Ca+, Mg, and nitrate (NO3). - Protein-like fractions of the fluorescing DOM increase with increasing Ca+, Mg, and nitrate (NO3 - and decrease with increasing DOM, sodium, potassium (K) and fluoride (F) concentration). These correlations suggest that seasonal hydrological fluxes, rather than direct causation, drive changes in humic and protein fractions. Humic fractions are higher during periods of snowmelt and runoff compared to baseflow conditions. Snowmelt leads to elevated DOC as it is ‘flushed’ from the catchments. Correlations among ions and topographical or landcover features suggest co-correlation rather than causation…. 3.3.4 Spearman’s correlation figure for AGU poster 2024 Figure 3.11: Figure.

To decide on a method, we need to understand the relationships among our variables to decide if and how we want to deal with collinearity. In another workbook (.ipynb), we have seen collinearity between independent variables e.g. (slope and percent_Old.Forest). Multicollinearity can be a problem when fitting regression models as it makes it harder to interpret our coefficients. Using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) we can explore collinearity between our independent variables. Interpreting the results: If the VIF is less than 5, multicollinearity is typically not a concern. If VIF is between 5 and 10, there may be some moderate multicollinearity. If VIF is greater than 10, multicollinearity is likely a serious issue, and you may want to consider removing or transforming variables. 3.3.14.1 Multicollinearity ## doc_mg.l na_mg.l nh4_mg.l ## 2.773422 3.836951 1.776459 ## K_mg.l Mg_mg.l Ca_mg.l ## 3.174043 4.692212 6.557847 ## F_mg.l Cl_mg.l NO3_mg.l ## 1.805230 2.401802 2.222772 ## area_km Qm3_s percent_1.5 ## 5.890812 1.183790 1810.657331 ## percent_6.10 percent_11.15 slope_mean ## 1026.835121 559.358510 8.325173 ## aspect_mean ndmi_raster_mean ndvi_raster_mean ## 6.799846 12.823483 6.024474 ## disttostreams_mean percent_Beetle.kill percent_Old.Forest ## 4.572233 167.668833 135.680021 ## percent_cut.regenerating percent_Tundra distance.to.outlet ## 40.850573 113.775325 10.038567 So given that we have a lot of mulitcollinearity, we can systematically remove variables that are non-essential or redundant: ## area_km slope_mean aspect_mean ## 1.821739 3.137001 4.071621 ## ndmi_raster_mean ndvi_raster_mean disttostreams_mean ## 4.811914 3.600649 3.860539 ## percent_Beetle.kill percent_Old.Forest percent_cut.regenerating ## 84.413534 77.730036 22.383774 ## percent_Tundra ## 54.771818 But ultimately we have several variables contributing to a high VIF that are all important to our question. Therefore, we can try RDA and PCA as a dimension reduction technique, assuming we remove some of the most redundant variables. This should transform() the predictors into a smaller set of uncorrelated PCs (components) that still explain most of the variance. 3.3.14.2 Distributions and standardization To perform RDA and PCA, explanatory and response variables must be centered, standardized, transformed or normalized So these are all quantitative variables with different units and numerical ranges. Standardization transforms the variables so they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Let’s view the scaled distributions of standardized explanatory variables: Figure 3.21: Figure. Checking out the distribution of explanatory variables Now we will check the distributions of our response variables Figure 3.22: Figure. Checking out the distribution of response variables Our response variables are both right and left-skewed unimodal. We may need to make the data more symmetrical or approximately normal, This can ensure that they contribute equally to the analysis and RDA assumes linear relationships between variables. But these may be be close enough to approximately normal once they are standardized/z-scored (subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation for each variable): The scales are similar, the units are the same. Let’s move forward for now. Initial exploration with PCA Q² evaluates how well the model can predict unseen data based on the selected number of components. A higher Q² value indicates better predictive performance. Commonly, a Q² value greater than 0.095 is considered an acceptable threshold for a good predictive model. None of our components have Q² total greater than 0.095. This suggests that the PLS model may not have enough predictive power to explain the relationship between the response variables and explanatory variables, based on cross-validation. We know the relationships between individual response variables and explanatory variables are strong. PLS does not assume normality of the data, though scaling does seem to help the Q2. From the tutorial: “We now set a grid of values - thin at the start, but also restricted to a small number of genes for a parsimonious model, which we will test for each of the two components in the tune.spls() function, using the MAE criterion.” So, in simpler terms, I think this means this piece of code is tuning a partial least squares (PLS) regression model using cross-validation to find the best number of variables to include in the model. I want to include all response variables at this point, so this is adapted from the tutorial: ## Warning: &lt;anonymous&gt;: ... may be used in an incorrect context: ## spls(X = X, Y = Y, keepX = c(choice.keepX, keepX), keepY = c(choice.keepY, ## keepY), ncomp = comp, mode = mode, ...) ## Warning: &lt;anonymous&gt;: ... may be used in an incorrect context: ## spls(X = X, Y = Y, keepX = c(choice.keepX, keepX), keepY = c(choice.keepY, ## keepY), ncomp = comp, mode = mode, ...) ## Importance of components: ## PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 ## Standard deviation 2.1860 1.4916 1.3046 1.1224 0.91363 0.68046 0.6681 0.36959 ## Proportion of Variance 0.3982 0.1854 0.1418 0.1050 0.06956 0.03859 0.0372 0.01138 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.3982 0.5836 0.7254 0.8304 0.89997 0.93856 0.9758 0.98714 ## PC9 PC10 PC11 PC12 ## Standard deviation 0.3305 0.18584 0.10306 8.348e-11 ## Proportion of Variance 0.0091 0.00288 0.00089 0.000e+00 ## Cumulative Proportion 0.9962 0.99911 1.00000 1.000e+00 ## Warning: The SGCCA algorithm did not converge 3.3.15 RDA (Redundancy Analysis) https://r.qcbs.ca/workshop10/book-en/redundancy-analysis.html Similar to PCA, but RDA is a constrained method that requries two datasets, one for response variables (e.g., PARAFAC component fractions) and one for explanatory variables (watershed characteristics) RDA identifies the portion of the variation in the response dataset that can be explained by the explanatory variables. So this tells us how much of the variability in the response variables is explained by the predictors. 3.3.15.1 All data - Workflow hidden except results for comparison to other subsets In the summary tables, the ‘Importance of components’ tells us the eigenvalues and their contributions to the variance for RDA components 1-3 and the PCs 1-3. ie. an eigenvalue represents the amount of variance explained by each component. Higher eigenvalues indicate that the component explains a larger portion of the total variance in the data. Then the Proportion Explained is the fraction of the total variance explained by each component. So at RDA1: Proportion Explained, we might see 0.32, which means RDA explains approximately 32% of the totalvariance. Then the cumulative Proportion tells us how much more of the variation is explianed as we add more components.

Let’s look at the coefficients associated with the variables in RDA1.

This could be due to the variable being strongly correlated with the main gradient in the data but lacking statistical robustness (due to multicollinearity?). Variables like this might capture major trends in the data but don’t significantly improve the fit of the model when tested. This could mean that they are redundant or that the sample size is too small to detect their significance. Less influential but statistically significant means they account for a relatively small but non-random portion of the total variation. Might not be the primary drivers of variation, but they can be still be important to our understanding of secondary influences/trends. Figure 3.23: Figure. RDA1 loadings tell us the direction and strength between each explantory variable and the RDA1 component. Interpreting loadings for RDA1: Recall that there are three response variables here, each will have a loading that indicates its correlation with RDA1. Humic components 1 and 2 will have similar loadings (positive and negative) on RDA1, where the protein-like component will have the opposite loading. In the biplot, this should be visible as response variable vectors pointing in opposite directions. Figure 3.24: Figure.

Together, the first three components explain the majority of the total variance, which (I think) is a better threshold for interpretation than &lt;50%. Let’s see. Visualize the PC1 loadings to see what our important drivers are: In this case, PC1 might represent a gradient related to DOC lability or stability across the landscape (e.g., a transition from microbial activity-driven DOC production in low slopes, southern aspects, more moist sub-watersheds, to more labile DOC driven by hydrological transport in older forests due to higher slopes, northern aspects and drier sub-watersheds. Subwatersheds with older forests tend to be on higher slopes, northern aspects, which receive less solar radiation (cooler, less microbial activity). These also retain snow for longer, sustaining humic inputs through the falling limb (we might see this in Lexen)? A lot more detail is applied to this below. …BUT, PCA is unsupervised and doesn’t directly consider the response variable. So how well does PC1 explain the variability of the first PARAFAC component (humic)?. Let’s look at PC1 in 2-D space by plotting it against our response variable to see how PC1 correlates with the sample fraction of Humic Component1. We can get a sense of the strength and direction of the relationship: Meh.

I can increase the amount of variability by remove more variables from the PCA, but this still does not drastically improve the relationship between PC1 and PARAFAC component 1.

Save this: Interpreting loadings for PC1: Negative Loadings Examples, clarifications: percent_Old.Forest as measured by a landcover classificaiton model (hand corrected Random Forest) percent_11.15 is the percent of the each subwatershed containing by forest btwn 11 and 15m tall as measured pixel counts of the canopy height model. These trees are ‘old’ but not the rare ancients found in the riparian valley. A negative loading in PC1 means that higher values of these variables are associated with lower values of the principal component (PC1), which ‘represents a particular combination of the variation explained by the dataset’ or in my words, a regression line that best fits the multidimensional space created by all of the variables. I think this means these are related to reduced Component1 fractions. Again, this is counter to Fegel results and the logic that the older forests would contain more recalcitrant sources of DOC. However, higher slopes and more tundra-covered areas also may negatively influence Component 1 humic fractions. This makes sense, as DOM is likely hydrologically transported faster in these conditions, with less time or material for microbial activity, transporting DOC while it is still labile. Positive Loadings: On the other hand, positive loadings mean that higher values of these variables contribute positively to PC1. Top examples, clarification: aspect higher aspect values (180 to 270) represent south and west aspects, 0-90 represent north and east. Previous studies that conclude that microbial decomposition of soil organic matter and enzyme activities associated with soil C, N, and P cycling increased with increasing temperature: Liu et al 2021 in Effects of natural vegetation restoration on DOM..and they cite: Min et al., 2019; Nazaries et al., 2015; Pang et al., 2015. disttostreams_mean is derived from a whitebox raster that calculates the downslope distance to the nearest downslope stream cell. This is assumed to give us a relative idea of the retention time of allochthonous water. Larger distances to the stream mean potentially more time for microbial activity to improve recalcitrance before DOM enters the stream channel. percent_cut.regenerating is the percent of subwatershed area covered by ‘cut’ plots. Thse are potentially areas of ‘newer’ forests, and in Deadhorse, many of these appear similar to meadows. We might expect a decreased humic component with regenerating forest as they can have lower litter production, shallow root systems, leading to decreased input of humic subtances (notes from a Tim meeting). However, we might be at an older stage of succession at this point (40+ years post harvest at this point). Roots are deeper, litter and deadwood has likely had time to accumulate in these plots. This can enhance complex, recalcitrant carbon compounds, like our humic Component1. percent_Beetle.kill Similar to above, beetle kill leaves the deadwood of old trees in place. We might expect these to be a source of recalcitrant carbon. TWI is arguably important in the fraction of humic components. Like distancetostreams, is likely an indication of the allochthonous water retention. In other words, increased water retention in areas with higher wetness indices, where DOM originating from surrounding soils (allochthonous DOM) can remain for extended periods may allow for greater microbial processing of DOM, leading to the accumulation of more recalcitrant, humic Components before the DOM is transported into the stream channel. "],["normalized-doc.html", "3.4 2. Normalized DOC", " 3.4 2. Normalized DOC As well as observing fractions of fluorescing DOC, we can normalize our total ‘loading’ or fluorescence by the DOC concentration. This could help us better examine lability of DOC and how much fluorescence signal is produced per unit of carbon and differences in overall DOM reactivity (i.e., does a larger proportion of DOM fluoresce in some samples relative to others). 3.4.1 Box plots - DOC normalized loadings Boxplots are visualizing DOC normalized loadings among watersheds Figure 3.26: Figure. Box plots showing the relationships the normalized fluorescence intensity and watershed. dh,dhn and dhs = Deadhorse, fc = Fool Creek. Horizontal bars indicate sample median, asterisks indicate sample mean. Whiskers (vertical lines) extend to the most extreme data point which is no more than range times the interquartile range from the box We can also explore normalized intensity, or the total fluorescence per unit of DOC of each PARAFAC component. Why do we care? Without normalization fluorescence intensity can be heaviliy influenced by DOC concentration. 3.4.1.1 Humic1 - or PARAFAC component 1 Figure 3.27: Figure.

If green, then the plot represents a subset of dates By looking at these, we are answering: “How does the actual concentration of a specific DOC component (humic, protein-like, etc.) change in relation to these watershed variables?” #### ALL EEMS ##### Landcover Figure 3.30: Figure.

Color indicates direction and correlation value (Pearson’s). Asterisks indicate level of significance. This figure indicates that: - The fluorescence intensity of humic DOM slightly decreases with high percentages of 6-10m canopy - The fluorescence intensity of humic DOM slightly increases with increasing watershed coverage of very tall canopy &gt;15m. Protein-like fluorescence intensity decreases with high percentages of cut or regenerating forest, and canopy between 6 and 10m, but increase with increased coverage by Tundra. Significant but weaker correlations indicate that protein-like fractions increase with increasing meadow and old forest coverage. Overall, these trends are similar to those seen when looking at fractions (rather than normalized intensities) but with lower correlations and less significance (greater variation) 3.4.2.0.1 Topo and moisture - all EEMS Figure 3.31: Figure.

Color indicates direction and correlation value (Pearson’s). Asterisks indicate level of significance. This figure indicates that: - the intensity of humic fluorescing DOM increases with increasing discharge. Humic fractions (DOC composition) show more relationships. Protein-like fluorescence intensity increases with increasing slope and distance from outlet. Protein-like fluorescence intensity decreases with increasing NDMI and TWI (moisture) and and increased mean distance to the stream channel. 3.4.2.0.2 Ions - all EEMS Figure 3.32: Figure.

This figure indicates that humic fraction of the fluorescing DOM increase with high percentages of tundra, and short canopy.

This figure indicates that humic fraction of the fluorescing DOM increase with increasing discharge, the distance that allochthonous water travels before reaching the stream channel, and increased watershed moisture. Humic fractions decrease with watershed slope. Protein-like fractions of the fluorescing DOM increase with increasing slope and decrease with increasing Q, increasing moisture indices, and increased mean distance to the stream channel. 3.4.2.1.2 Ions - summer 2022 (mid-June to mid July) Figure 3.35: Figure.

Standardization transforms the variables so they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Also, our response variables are right-skewed unimodal. We need to make the data more symmetrical or approximately normal, as RDA assumes linear relationships between variables. In the case of a right-skew, we can log transform to compress the long right tails and spread out lower values. Ok, now our responses are approximately normal. The scales are similar, the units are the same. I am not sure if we want to standardize/z-score these as well.

Unconstrained variance (0.009779, 51.9%): This is not explained by the predictors, so more than half of the variation is not explained by the model. This returns the note Some constraints or conditions were aliased because they were redundant. This can happen if terms are linearly dependent (collinear): ‘percent_Tundra’. -Similar to PCA, but it is a constrained method that requries two datasets, one for response variables (e.g., PARAFAC component fractions) and one for explanatory variables (watershed characteristics) RDA identifies the portion of the variation in the response dataset that can be explained by the explanatory variables.

Therefore, the peak DO between the 12th and 36th hour for each sample was used as the test ‘start’. - All 10min intervals were converted to a 2 hr rolling average to smooth short-term variation. -[DO] measurements were then transformed to a change in [DO] for each day by finding the slope of [DO]/time. 2.

We will cover structural theory after covering vocabulary 5.1.1 Path diagram of our model with tested indicators NOTE You may disagree with the arrangement of some of these indicators as they relate to the latent variables. That is as intended. We want to use this model to test the validity measures and demonstrate how they can guide a more logical path model. Latent variables are indirectly measured by means of variables which can be perfectly observed-measured. These types of variables are called manifest variables (MVs), also known as indicators. We use the information contained in indicators to obtain an approximate representation of the latent variable. Inner Model – Captures the relationships between latent variables (e.g., topography → landcover → runoff → DOC composition). The Outer Model Represents how the manifest variables/indicators load onto their corresponding latent variables. Here, we need to consider whether the lack of strong correlations within indicator sets on the “cause” side could limit the model’s explanatory power in capturing the full variance of latent variables like topography. There are checks to measure this. We will explore these after we run the model. Exogeneous latent variables only explain other constructs in the model. (e.g. Topography) Indicators of these be called formative Endogeneous latent variables are being explained in the model(Hydrological, landcover and DOM), according to Fig.1.1 in Hair et al. 2021, Indicators of these may be called reflexive variables Measurement theory specifies how the latent variables are measured. Since these are unobservable variables, we can measure them with ‘reflective ’measurements (i.e., direction of the arrows is from the indicator to the latent variable) or ‘formative’ measurements (arrow is from the latent variable to the measurement, indicating that the latent variable ‘causes’ the measurement). Structural theory shows how the latent variables are related to one another. When the path model is developed, the sequence is from left to right, Variables on the left side of the path are independent variables, and variables on the right side are dependent. Moreover, variables on the left are show a sequentially preceding and predicting the variables on the right. When variables are in the middle of the model, the serve as both independent and dependent variables in the structural model. Error terms are connected to the endogenous constructs and (reflectively) measured indicators. Error terms represent the unexplained variance when path models are estimated. i.e. the difference between the model’s in-sample prediction of a value and an observed value of an indicator or latent variable. In contrast, the formatively measured indicators (like those of topography) do not have error terms. And for DOM lability, the direction of the relationships between the latent variable and indicator are not relevant, as they are assumed to be equivalent. So, there is no error term associated with those indicators. Now that we have a path model, we need to test the theoretical relationships within that model. "],["data-managment-transformation.html", "5.2 Data managment / transformation", " 5.2 Data managment / transformation For this model demonstration, our EEMs dataset has been filtered to ‘stream’ samples only (no wells) (n= 91). Our full sample, including wells, and a filtered sample evaluating only wells returns reduced DOM r^2 values (between 0.15 and .3) relative to streams alone, which tend to yield better results. The selection process for these variables includes review of the specific response variable, and the correlations of that variable with the explanatory variables found in combine_PARAFAC_w_ws, part 1.B.ii. 1. More on size: - A.10x rule: sample size should be – to 10x the number if independent variables (number of arrows pointing to a a latent variable) (Barclay, Higgins &amp; Thompson, 1995) - May still be too small, depending on complexity of model. - B. inverse square root method (a retrospective approach) -We take the path coefficient (a number showing the strength of the relationship between two variables) and divide it by its standard error (a measure of how much this coefficient might vary if the analysis is repeated). -Compare this ratio to a critical value that depends on the significance level we’re using (e.g., 1.96 for a 5% significance level in a two-tailed test). If the ratio is greater than the critical value, it suggests the relationship (path coefficient) is statistically significant. Hair 2021 pg 17 has equations for the desired significance level, e.g., \\[ \\text{Significance level} = 5\\%: \\quad n_{\\text{min}} &gt; \\left( \\frac{2.486}{p_{\\text{min}}} \\right)^2 \\] Where pmin is the value of the path coefficient with the minimum magnitude in the PLS path model. We can find that after we run the model with pls_model$path_coefs 2. Measurement scales measurements should be on a metric scale, ratio or interval scale. Could also be ordinal scales if datapoints are equidistant, or with binary data. Categorical data can be binary-coded, but may need additional attention when making interpretations. See Hair et al. 2022 PLS-SEM Primer if it comes to this 3. Missing data: All missing values need to be treated or removed. if less than 5% of values are missing per indicator, mean replacement or nearest neighbor will likely be used, depending on the nature of the missing data. We don’t have many of these. 4. Treatment of FEF data These are all quantitative variables with different units and numerical ranges. We first log-transformed discharge adding 1e-9 as a constant Transformations are common when dealing with variables that have non-normal distributions or large ranges in ecology. Justifying transformations based on the ecological characteristics of the data (e.g., discharge typically has an exponential distribution in headwater streams) enhances the credibility of the model. Using transformations helps to uncover meaningful ecological patterns that might be masked if extreme or skewed data overpowered the model. In practice, documenting and justifying each transformation based on ecological knowledge of the variables strengthens the model’s interpretability and credibility. This approach allows transformations to enhance the alignment between model structure and real-world processes. After transforming discharge, we standardized all columns in the dataframe. Standardization transforms the variables so they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Let’s view the scaled distributions of standardized explanatory variables: Figure 5.1: Figure.

Model Estimation using the PLS-SEM algorithm. The algorithm needs to determine the scores of the constructs that are used as input for partial regression models within the path model. After the algorithm has calculated the construct scores, the scores are used to estimate each partial regression model in the path model. As a result, we obtain the estimates for all relationships in the measurement models (i.e., the indicator weights/loadings) and the structural model (i.e., the path coefficients).

A plot of result reliability measures: plot(summary_simple_fef$reliability) Indicator reliability: First we want to know how much of each indicator’s variance is explained by the latent variable it is assigned to. ‘To compute an indicator’s explained variance, we need to square the indicator loading, which is the bivariate correlation between indicator and construct. As such, the indicator reliability indicates the communality of an indicator. Indicator loadings above 0.708 are recommended, since they indicate that the construct explains more than 50 percent of the indicator’s variance, thus providing acceptable indicator reliability.’ Hair et al. 2021 ## TOPO LANDCOVER HYDRO DOC ## topo_1 0.665 0.000 0.000 0.000 ## topo_2 0.755 0.000 0.000 0.000 ## topo_3 0.279 0.000 0.000 0.000 ## topo_4 0.846 0.000 0.000 0.000 ## hydro_1 0.000 0.000 1.000 0.000 ## landcover_1 0.000 0.807 0.000 0.000 ## landcover_2 0.000 0.783 0.000 0.000 ## doc_1 0.000 0.000 0.000 1.000 Take home: Our current topo_3 (subwatershed area in m^2) as a low reliability which can contribute to more measurement error to the model, which can weaken the model’s validity and interpretability. This means that less than 50% of it’s variance is explained by other ‘topography’ indicators, which makes sense. topo_3 represents watershed area may be a better variable to group with ‘hydrology’ rather than topograhy. We’ll test this along with other model variations in the next chapter. Then we want to check the ‘internal consistency reliability’ (rhoC). Internal consistency reliability is the extent to which indicators measuring the same construct are associated with each other. ’Higher values indicate higher levels of reliability. For example, reliability values between 0.60 and 0.70 are considered “acceptable in exploratory research,” whereas values between 0.70 and 0.90 range from “satisfactory to good.” Values above 0.90 (and definitely above 0.95) are problematic, since they indicate that the indicators are redundant, thereby reducing construct validity (Diamantopoulos, Sarstedt, Fuchs, Wilczynski, &amp; Kaiser, 2012).’Hair et al. 2021 Other sources indicate that 0.85 is a more conservative threshold value. ## alpha rhoC AVE rhoA ## TOPO 0.792 0.871 0.636 0.836 ## LANDCOVER 0.742 0.886 0.795 0.744 ## HYDRO 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 ## DOC 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 ## ## Alpha, rhoC, and rhoA should exceed 0.7 while AVE should exceed 0.5 Our rhoC values fall in the higher (not ideal) range of ‘satisfactory to good’ but our ‘problematic’ values are due to these latent values having single indicators, so they aren’t truly problematic. Convergent Validity: When we assess convergent validity, we’re checking how well each indicator represents the latent variable it’s supposed to measure. For convergent validity, we want to see if the indicators of the same latent variable are closely related rather than explaining different processes. This is where average variance extracted (AVE) comes in: AVE shows how much of the total variance in the indicators is actually explained by the construct. ## alpha rhoC AVE rhoA ## TOPO 0.792 0.871 0.636 0.836 ## LANDCOVER 0.742 0.886 0.795 0.744 ## HYDRO 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 ## DOC 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 ## ## Alpha, rhoC, and rhoA should exceed 0.7 while AVE should exceed 0.5 Here then we should not be surprised to see 1.00 for HYDRO and DOC AVE, as, up to this point, we have included only one indicator for these latent variables. However, for topo and landcover, we can be confident that we have chosen variables that are measuring the same thing as our AVE are high (over 0.5) Discriminant Validity Now we want to make sure that different latent variables in the model are distinct from each other, ie. they measure different concepts. One way to check this is by using the heterotrait–monotrait (HTMT) ratio. If the HTMT values are low (typically below 0.9), it indicates that the constructs are distinct and measure different concepts. ## TOPO LANDCOVER HYDRO DOC ## TOPO . . . . ## LANDCOVER 1.053 . . . ## HYDRO 0.486 0.501 . . ## DOC 0.584 0.554 0.305 . In this current configuration, topo and landcover may not be distinct. This is hardly surprising, landcover indicators are often directly and strongly correlated with many of the topographical variables. In this case, we are looking at the percentage of each subwatershed that is covered by ‘cut/regenerating’ forest. Many of these sites were on lower slopes (likely for ease of access), and in the case of Deadhorse, almost entirely on the southern aspect. Furthermore, ‘TWI’ or the total wetness index likely drives NDVI. A high correlation between topography and landcover in our SEM model isn’t necessarily problematic if it aligns with the underlying ecology of the study area Combining them into a single latent variable isn’t ideal for our research question, where we want to see if we can evaluate the impacts of land cover independent of topography. We may not have this issue if we look at other land cover types. Let’s come back to this to see if it needs addressing. We might be able to control for one construct in relation to the other, such as controlling for topography when examining landcover’s effect, to clarify their roles without removing one or the other. "],["bootstrapping-for-significance.html", "5.4 Bootstrapping for significance", " 5.4 Bootstrapping for significance PLS-SEM is a nonparametric method – thus, we need to perform bootstrapping to estimate standard errors and compute confidence intervals.

In other words, we use 1,000 bootstrap subsamples. However, the final result computations should draw on 10,000 subsamples (Streukens &amp; Leroi-Werelds, 2016).

Again, our bootstrapped HTMT ratio indicating the high correlation between topography and landcover. The bootstrapping procedure yields t-values for the indicator weights (and other model parameters). We need to compare these t-values with the critical values from the standard normal distribution to decide whether the coefficients are significantly different from zero. Assuming a significance level of 5%, a t-value above 1.96 (two-tailed test) suggests that the indicator weight is statistically significant. Interpretation: As an example between Landcover and DOC B = -0.068: This is the standardized path coefficient between the two latent variables. A negative value (-0.068) indicates a weak negative relationship, meaning that as one variable increases slightly, the other decreases slightly, though the effect is minimal here. 95% CI [-0.332, 0.261]: This is the 95% confidence interval for the beta value, giving a range within which the true beta value is likely to fall, with 95% confidence. Since this interval includes zero (spanning from -0.332 to 0.261), the effect of landcover on DOC here could be statistically insignificant. So, in this current configuration, the standardized path coefficients between TOPO and LANDCOVER are significant and TOPO and DOC are significant (as our TOPO indicator variables increase, the fragment of DOC that is protein-like increases), but as the model is organized now, the effect of Landcover and hydrology are minimal and not significant.

A plot of result reliability measures: 6.2.1 Results of bootstrapped PLS This combination of indicators provides a reliable and valid measurement of the ‘labile’ construct/latent variable, as indicated by significant loadings, AVE &gt; 0.5, and high reliability metrics (RhoC, alpha, and rhoA &gt; 0.7). The significant lambda values indicate that each indicator meaningfully contributes to and effectively represents the ‘labile’ construct. This suggests a strong relationship between the latent variable and its indicators, confirming that the indicators are well-aligned with the underlying concept of ‘labile’. Other values in the model: beta coefficients also called path coefficients represent the strength and direction of the relationship between the latent variables, similar to regression coefficients. So a higher B coefficient suggests a stronger predictive influence of the independent/predictor construct on the dependent construct. R^2 values aka the coefficient of determination. This is the amount of variance in that construct explained by its predictor constructs. In other words, it is the combined effect of all predictors on that construct. So in this example 45% of the variance in LABILE is explained by topography, landcover and discharge. In this example, the landcover indicator is ‘% Beetle kill coverage’. Let’s test other landcover indicators to see if any others are better predictors of DOM. We can do this in a loop where we test different sets of landcover indicators and print the model summaries to compare coefficients.

To include classifications in a PLS model, we generate a column in the dataset for each classification, and a binomial indicators in each row. For example, of the flow state at the time of sampling is just after peak flow, that sample will have a ‘1’ in the upper descending limb column, and a ‘0’ in all others. Potential classifications are ‘rising limb’, ‘upper descending limb’, ‘lower descending limb’ and baseflow. In the path model, lower_decreasing = state_1, upper_decreasing = state_2, increasing = state_3. These classifications were developed by finding the date of peak flow for the respective year and stream, and the dates for the end and beginning of baseflow for each calendar year. Then the ‘midway’ point between peakflow and the first date of baseflow delineates upper and lower descending limbs. (find the name of this script, pretty sure its an .ipynb) Build the outer model or ‘constructs’ or latent variables This script cycles through multiple landcover indicators, saving the summary results for each run to a dataframe ‘results’. The first several model summaries are printed. We find that no models that include ‘flow state’ have sufficient reliability measures. I have tried a ‘flow state’ construct with all indicators (rising limb, upper descending limb, lower descending limb, baseflow) and with the two most common in our sample set (lower descending limb, baseflow). If reliability is low, it means the construct is not accurately or consistently representing the latent variable, which can have significant implications for the results and interpretations. ## $allperc ## ## Results from package seminr (2.3.4) ## ## Path Coefficients: ## HYDRO LANDCOVER DOM ## R^2 0.275 0.581 0.457 ## AdjR^2 0.250 0.576 0.432 ## TOPO 0.123 0.762 -0.453 ## LANDCOVER -0.553 . -0.140 ## HYDRO . . 0.215 ## STATE -0.245 . 0.100 ## ## Reliability: ## alpha rhoC AVE rhoA ## TOPO 0.907 0.940 0.838 0.965 ## LANDCOVER 0.865 0.936 0.880 0.884 ## HYDRO 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 ## STATE -2.342 0.173 0.695 3.088 ## DOM 0.766 0.852 0.597 0.815 ## ## Alpha, rhoC, and rhoA should exceed 0.7 while AVE should exceed 0.5 ## ## ## $VIMI ## ## Results from package seminr (2.3.4) ## ## Path Coefficients: ## HYDRO LANDCOVER DOM ## R^2 0.275 0.581 0.457 ## AdjR^2 0.250 0.576 0.432 ## TOPO 0.123 0.762 -0.453 ## LANDCOVER -0.553 . -0.140 ## HYDRO . . 0.215 ## STATE -0.245 . 0.100 ## ## Reliability: ## alpha rhoC AVE rhoA ## TOPO 0.907 0.940 0.838 0.965 ## LANDCOVER 0.865 0.936 0.880 0.884 ## HYDRO 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 ## STATE -2.342 0.173 0.695 3.088 ## DOM 0.766 0.852 0.597 0.815 ## ## Alpha, rhoC, and rhoA should exceed 0.7 while AVE should exceed 0.5 ## ## ## $allcanopy ## ## Results from package seminr (2.3.4) ## ## Path Coefficients: ## HYDRO LANDCOVER DOM ## R^2 0.275 0.581 0.457 ## AdjR^2 0.250 0.576 0.432 ## TOPO 0.123 0.762 -0.453 ## LANDCOVER -0.553 . -0.140 ## HYDRO . . 0.215 ## STATE -0.245 . 0.100 ## ## Reliability: ## alpha rhoC AVE rhoA ## TOPO 0.907 0.940 0.838 0.965 ## LANDCOVER 0.865 0.936 0.880 0.884 ## HYDRO 1.000 1.000 1.000 1.000 ## STATE -2.342 0.173 0.695 3.088 ## DOM 0.766 0.852 0.597 0.815 ## ## Alpha, rhoC, and rhoA should exceed 0.7 while AVE should exceed 0.5 "],["model-5-labile-early-season---streams.html", "6.5 Model 5: LABILE early season - streams", " 6.5 Model 5: LABILE early season - streams ABOUT THIS MODEL - stream samples during peak lower descending to baseflow (August - April 30) n=30 - response is LABILE.

Potential responses are from: 1. EEMS: “peak_A_250.450”, “peak_C_350.450”, “peak_T_275.340”, “Fluorescence_Index”, “SUVA254”, “peak_ratioAT”, “peak_ratioCA”,“peak_ratioCT” Where: peak_A_250.450 and peak_C_350.450 are typically intersections on the emission-excitation matrix where a peak is associated with the presence humic-like substances. It is an indicator of humic content, which generally represents more refractory/recalcitrant (less biodegradable) dissolved organic matter (DOM). PeaK C may be less degraded, more recently produced (younger or more microbially souced?). Peak A may be more degraded,older derived from terrestrail souces with longer residence time. peak_T_275_340 - indicator of protein-like substances (tryptophan) and can be an indicator of recently produced, labile DOM. Fluorescence_Index: helps distinguish between terrestrial and microbial sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM). It is the ratio of fluorescence intensities at emission 475 with excitation at 370 nm. FI around 1.2 or lower: Indicates a stronger terrestrial DOM source, often linked to plant and soil organic matter inputs. FI around 1.4 or higher: Suggests a more microbial DOM source, often derived from algae, bacteria, or other microbial production. Microbially derived DOM is generally more labile than terrestrial DOM. SUVA: is specific Ultraviolet Absorbance at 254nm (absorbance at 254nm normalized by DOC concentration) and is an indicator of aromacity (&gt;4L/mg.m) is higher aromatic content, usually associated with terrestrial, humic-like DOM, where lower (&lt;2-3L/mg.m) is usually associated with microbial, more labile sources. Peak ratios: are ratios of the peaks A, C and T to get an idea of the relative abundances of humic: protein-like substances. PARAFAC: norm_loadings, norm_PARAF_c1, norm_PARAF_c2, norm_PARAF_c3, PARAF_comp_1, PARAF_comp_2, PARAF_comp_3, total_loadings, Sample, relative_load_comp_1, relative_load_comp_2, relative_load_comp_3 Where: total_loadings refers to the total absorbance of the entire sample, norm_loadings are the loadings normalized by the sample DOC concentration, and ‘relative load’ refers to the fraction of the total loading represented by each component. Component 1, 2 and 3 matrices are shown in section 3. 1 and 2 represent humic components. Component 3 matches protein-like component matrices. BOD: daily_DOC_loss, daily_rate_of_change_Ox Total DOC consumed during biological oxygen demand assays were measured and normalized by the number of days that the experiment was run. Similarly, dissolved oxygen (DO) was measured at 10minute intervals, then a DO loss per day was calculated for each sample (04_BOD_results_summary). Preliminary data exploration suggests that few correlations exist between BOD results and other responses, or landscape characteristics, except maybe DOC normalized PARAFAC component loadings. To generate a two model analysis, I will group measured responses (i.e.indicators) into ‘humic’ or ‘protein-like’ latent variables. Then we will evaluate the relatedness of each indicator within the two variables to determine how each latent variable should be defined. PLS-SEM iteratively assigns weights to each indicator to maximize the explained variance of the latent variable in the structural model (this process is conceptually similar to PCA). In the bootstrapped model, we will see the strength of the relationship between each indicator and composite represented by lambda.

A plot of result reliability measures: Inspect the bootstrapped indicator loadings This combination of indicators provides a reliable and valid measurement of the ‘humic’ construct/latent variable, as indicated by significant loadings, AVE &gt; 0.5, and high reliability metrics (RhoC, alpha, and rhoA &gt; 0.7). The significant lambda values indicate that each indicator meaningfully contributes to and effectively represents the ‘humic’ construct. This suggests a strong relationship between the latent variable and its indicators, confirming that the indicators are well-aligned with the underlying concept of ‘humic’. Other values in the model: beta coefficients also called path coefficients represent the strength and direction of the relationship between the latent variables, similar to regression coefficients. So a higher B coefficient suggests a stronger predictive influence of the independent/predictor construct on the dependent construct. R^2 values aka the coefficient of determination. This is the amount of variance in that construct explained by its predictor constructs. In other words, it is the combined effect of all predictors on that construct. So in this example 45% of the variance in HUMIC is explained by topography, landcover and discharge. In this example, the landcover indicator is ‘% Beetle kill coverage’. Let’s test other landcover indicators to see if any others are better predictors of DOM. We can do this in a loop where we test different sets of landcover indicators and print the model summaries to compare coefficients.

If we evaluate the R^2 for each of our dependent variables, specifically HUMIC to determine the amount of variance in that construct explained by its predictor constructs…we see that old forest and beetle kill seem to have similar, weak effects on the ‘HUMIC’ construct, with similar prediction strength from the other latent variables.

To include classifications in a PLS model, we generate a column in the dataset for each classification, and a binomial indicators in each row. For example, of the flow state at the time of sampling is just after peak flow, that sample will have a ‘1’ in the upper descending limb column, and a ‘0’ in all others. Potential classifications are ‘rising limb’, ‘upper descending limb’, ‘lower descending limb’ and baseflow. In the path model, lower_decreasing = state_1, upper_decreasing = state_2, increasing = state_3. These classifications were developed by finding the date of peak flow for the respective year and stream, and the dates for the end and beginning of baseflow for each calendar year. Then the ‘midway’ point between peakflow and the first date of baseflow delineates upper and lower descending limbs. (find the name of this script, pretty sure its an .ipynb) Build the outer model or ‘constructs’ or latent variables This script cycles through multiple landcover indicators, saving the summary results for each run to a dataframe ‘results’. The first several model summaries are printed. We find that no models that include ‘flow state’ have sufficient reliability measures. I have tried a ‘flow state’ construct with all indicators (rising limb, upper descending limb, lower descending limb, baseflow) and with the two most common in our sample set (lower descending limb, baseflow). If reliability is low, it means the construct is not accurately or consistently representing the latent variable, which can have significant implications for the results and interpretations.

"],["model-1.html", "9.1 Model 1:", " 9.1 Model 1: Figure: PLS-SEM models depicting the effects of four variables on the humic fraction of fluorescing DOM in high flows (a) and low flows (b). The beta coefficients (β) in each relationship indicates the strength of the relationship between latent variables. Negative relationships are shown in red, positive relationships are printed in black, with significant relationships in bold text and asterisks to indicate level of significance. A negative β indicates that as the latent variable increases the dependent latent variable decreases. The coefficient of determination (R2) represents the proportion of variance in the latent variable explained by the variables (latent or observed). Higher R2 values indicate a better ability of the model to explain the variance in the latent variable. In this high-flow to low-flow comparison, we see that topography has a strong reinforcing effect on landcover composition, which in this model is characterized by the % coverage of harvested and regenerating forest, and the % of beetle kill affected forest. In high flows, the humic fraction of fluorescing DOM is strong and positive, indicating that as the % of beetle kill and regenerating forest increase, humic fractions increase. In low flows,the humic fraction of DOM decreases as NO3- concentration in the water sample increases. This could be an indication that NO3- is being allochthonously utilized by microbial communities to oxidize and polymerize carbon (increasing humic fractions) rather than being transported to the stream channel.
